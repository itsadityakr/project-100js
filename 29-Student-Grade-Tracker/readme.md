## **22. Objects, Dynamic Keys & Data Modeling**  

### **29. Student Grade Tracker**  
**Steps:**  
1. Create a form for inputting student details and scores.  
2. Store student data as objects with dynamic keys.  
3. Use `map()` to display students in a table format.  
4. Calculate average scores using `reduce()`.  
5. Assign grades based on score thresholds (e.g., A, B, C).  
6. Display results dynamically, updating when new data is entered.  
7. Optionally, allow sorting by name or score.
