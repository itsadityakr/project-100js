**Steps:**

2. Store submitted expenses in an array of objects.  
3. Convert the array to JSON and store it in `localStorage`.  
4. Retrieve stored expenses when the page loads and display them.  
5. Use `map()` to display expenses dynamically.  
6. Implement `reduce()` to calculate and display the total expense amount.  
7. Provide a filter option to show expenses by category.  
8. Allow users to delete individual expenses and update `localStorage`.
