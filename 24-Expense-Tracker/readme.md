Sure! Let's break this down step by step with detailed explanations and hints.

---

### **1. Create an Input Form for Expense Details**  
You'll need an HTML form with three input fields:  
- **Name**: Text input for the expense name (e.g., "Groceries," "Rent").  
- **Category**: Dropdown (`<select>`) or text input for categorizing expenses (e.g., "Food," "Transport").  
- **Amount**: Number input for entering the expense amount.  

A **submit button** should trigger an event to store the expense.

---

### **2. Store Submitted Expenses in an Array of Objects**  
- When the user submits the form, create an **object** containing the expense details.  
- Push this object into an **array** that holds all expenses.  

Example structure:  
```js
{ name: "Groceries", category: "Food", amount: 50 }
```
- Use `setState` if using React, or a global array if using vanilla JS.

---

### **3. Convert the Array to JSON and Store it in `localStorage`**  
- Convert the expenses array to JSON using `JSON.stringify()`.  
- Store it in `localStorage` so it persists even after refreshing the page.  
- Every time a new expense is added, update `localStorage`.

Example:  
```js
localStorage.setItem("expenses", JSON.stringify(expensesArray));
```

---

### **4. Retrieve Stored Expenses on Page Load**  
- When the page loads, check if there's any saved data in `localStorage`.  
- If found, parse it back into an array using `JSON.parse()`.  
- Update the UI accordingly.

Example:  
```js
const savedExpenses = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("expenses")) || [];
```

---

### **5. Use `map()` to Display Expenses Dynamically**  
- Use `map()` to loop through the expenses array and generate a list.  
- Display each expense's name, category, and amount dynamically.  

Example:  
```js
expensesArray.map(expense => (
  <div>
    <p>{expense.name} - {expense.category} - ${expense.amount}</p>
  </div>
));
```
- If using vanilla JS, use `forEach()` to append elements to the DOM.

---

### **6. Implement `reduce()` to Calculate Total Expenses**  
- Use the `reduce()` method to calculate the **total amount spent**.

Example:  
```js
const total = expensesArray.reduce((sum, expense) => sum + expense.amount, 0);
```
- Display this total in a separate section.

---

### **7. Provide a Filter Option by Category**  
- Add a dropdown or input field where users can **select a category**.  
- When selected, filter expenses using `.filter()` and update the displayed list.  

Example:  
```js
const filteredExpenses = expensesArray.filter(expense => expense.category === selectedCategory);
```

---

### **8. Allow Users to Delete Individual Expenses**  
- Add a **delete button** next to each expense.  
- When clicked, remove that expense from the array using `.filter()`.  
- Update `localStorage` and re-render the UI.

Example:  
```js
const updatedExpenses = expensesArray.filter(expense => expense.id !== idToRemove);
localStorage.setItem("expenses", JSON.stringify(updatedExpenses));
```

---

### **Bonus Features (Optional)**
- **Edit Expenses**: Let users modify an expense instead of deleting.  
- **Sort Expenses**: Sort by amount, category, or name.  
- **Date Feature**: Add a date field to track expenses over time.
